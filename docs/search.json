Computing likelihood surface great way explore parameter combinations almost identical likelihood compared maximum likelihood values. Investigating log-likelihood surface also approach assess uncertainty estimated parameters. large range parameter values almost log-likelihood indication careful putting much emphasis maximum-likelihood (best) estimates parameters. functions evoTS calculating log-likelihood surfaces report upper lower parameter estimates within two support units best estimate way assess uncertainty parameters (Edwards 1992). standard errors computed Hessian matrix always symmetric around point estimate, log-likelihood surface might (multivariate) normal. reported upper lower parameter estimates therefore often symmetrical around maximum likelihood parameter estimates. Estimating parameters model using maximum likelihood always run risk returning parameters local global optimum likelihood landscape. Investigating support surface combinations parameters one way explore topology likelihood-surface. Ridges log-likelihood surface can make challenging identify maximum likelihood estimates model parameters certain cases. Flat ridges may example cause identifiability issues problems model converge. Investigating log-likelihood surface can therefore help diagnose challenges related failures models convergence. evoTS package contain functions create likelihood surfaces univariate models evoTS paleoTS (e.g., loglik.surface.stasis, loglik.surface.URW, loglik.surface.GRW, loglik.surface.OU). functions need paleoTS object vectors containing candidate values parameters evaluated. candidate values investigate trial--error, maximum likelihood estimate parameter always interval. decelerated model evolution, vectors given arguments vstep.vec r.vec define pairwise combinations parameters function estimate log-likelihood. resolution input vectors therefore determines accurate visual representation support surface , including returned upper lower estimates printed console. higher resolution gives better precision, demands computation time.

Different ways parameterize matrix allows testing range evolutionary hypotheses using multivariate OU process. R matrix multivariate version unbiased random walk (multivariate OU model) either needs diagonal (elements diagonal -diagonal elements zero) complete (sense diagonal -diagonal elements non-zero), case matrix. Generally, can divide hypotheses tested using multivariate OU four different types: Independent evolution (diagonal elements R matrix, .e., equivalent fitting univariate models trait separately.) Independent adaptation (diagonal elements matrix R matrix completely parameterized. model, traits adapting independently toward optima, stochastic changes traits correlated.) least one trait affects optimum trait. diagonal least one -diagonal elements matrix non-zero. trait column non-zero -diagonal element affects optimum trait row non-zero -diagonal element. negative -diagonal element means trait evolves toward optimum determined trait, positive -diagonal element means trait evolve away optimum determined trait. stochastic changes trait can either correlated non-correlated. traits affect others optimum (different degrees). -diagonal elements sides diagonal parameterized matrix. stochastic changes trait can either correlated non-correlated. data set consisting two traits, four possible parameterizations matrix (see panels ). Independent adaptation traits (panel ), trait Y affecting optimum trait X (panel b), trait X affecting optimum trait Y, traits X Y affecting others optima (panel d). four ways parameterizing matrix can combined R matrix elements diagonal (stochastic changes traits uncorrelated) completely parameterized R matrix (stochastic changes traits correlated). matrix -diagonal elements investigates (Granger) causality two traits/variables (Granger 1969; Schweder 1970). Simply speaking, evidence Granger causality observations one time series useful forecasting observations one several time series, case one trait affects optimum another trait tracks lag. Multivariate OU models therefore enable us move beyond interpreting correlations among variables. correlation measure linear dependence two random variables, time dimension (.e., lag/evolutionary inertia tracking changing optimum) potential relationship two variables important Granger causality. correlation symmetric (correlation X Y correlation Y X), necessarily case Granger causality. X can (Granger) cause Y, without Y Granger-causing X. also possible implement model last trait data set evolves unbiased random walk affects optima traits data set. model can fitted defining .matrix =\"OUBM\", sets last diagonal element matrix zero. zero diagonal element matrix means tendency trait evolve towards optimal value (case unbiased random walk). Setting .matrix =\"OUBM\" automatically define R matrix diagonal elements (.e., option matrix override R matrix defined user). reason stochastic changes variable evolving unbiased random walk affect optimum traits, means stochastic trait dynamics traits evolving according OU model independent changes optimum. Multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models can fitted using two different functions evoTS. function fit.multivariate.OU allows user use pre-defined arguments R matrices parameterize matrices. .matrix can either defined “diag” (panel ), “upper.tri” (panel b ), “lower.tri” (panel c ), “full” (panel d ). Default “diag”. R.matrix can defined “diag” “symmetric”. function fit.multivariate.OU allows user test (sensible) hypotheses multivariate data consists two traits. data consists two traits, recommended use function fit.multivariate.OU.user.defined. function lets user define elements R matrices parameterized. function therefore allows full flexibility type hypotheses tested parameterization constrained follow pre-defined options matrix available function fit.multivariate.OU. investigate whether two traits S. yellowstonensis lineage show evidence independent evolution (diagonal elements R matrices) whether adaptation part trait dynamics independent two traits (diagonal matrix symmetric R matrix). test hypotheses using fit.multivariate.OU function. Note multivariate OU model demands much computational time compared univariate models simple multivariate models (like multivariate unbiased random walk). computational time grows exponentially dimension variance–covariance matrix (e.g., Felsenstein 1973; Hadﬁeld Nakagawa 2010; Freckleton 2012). time takes fit multivariate OU models therefore depends number traits length time series. Setting trace = TRUE allows user keep eye optimization proceeds. model independent adaptation correlated stochastic changes much better independent evolution model. half-life log diameter log number ribs 6.1% 4.9% length time-series, translates (13728 * 0.061 =) 837 (13728 * 0.049 =) 673 years respectively. correlation stochastic changes substantial, much reduced compared estimate correlation multivariate unbiased random walk. substantial part trait dynamics multivariate OU model due deterministic approach traits toward optima. model almost identical relative fit compared multivariate unbiased random walk according AICc, -competed unbiased random walk mode shift. now test complex parameterization matrix gives us better relative model fit according AICc. None models -diagonal elements matrix show better relative fit model diagonal symmetric R matrix. best model investigated remains multivariate unbiased random walk mode shift, allowing two different unbiased random walks explain trait dynamics. However, trust result, make sure run multivariate models different initial starting values increase chances finding potentially higher peak log-likelihood surface. number iterations can defined iterations argument. starting values drawn normal distribution standard deviation one. user can define larger smaller standard deviation using argument iter.sd. models possible investigate using fit.multivariate.OU function can also investigated using fit.multivariate.OU.user.defined function latter lets user define elements R matrices parameterized. elements R parameterized set zero given 1 0 respectively. can example fit model lower triangle matrix symmetric R matrix. lower triangle matrix means diameter affecting optimum number ribs.  fit.multivariate.OU.user.defined function especially handy data set consisting two traits. Let’s example assume multivariate data set consisting two phenotypic traits climatic variable, refer variables M, N O, respectively. Let’s assume hypothesis climatic variable (O) changing random walk affecting optimum trait N. also hypothesize trait N affects optimum trait M, trait M affecting optimum trait N. assume stochastic changes traits M, N correlated changes O uncorrelated M N. hypothesis parameterized defining R matrices following way.
