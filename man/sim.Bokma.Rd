\title{Simulate the Bokma model}
\usage{
sim.Bokma(
  ns = c(20, 20),
  vs = c(0.1, 0.1),
  vp = 1,
  nn = rep(30, sum(ns)),
  anc = c(0, 2),
  tt = 0:(sum(ns) - 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ns}{number of samples in time-series}

\item{vs}{step variance of the trait}

\item{vp}{phenotypic variance of each sample}

\item{nn}{vector of the number of individuals in each sample (identical sample sizes for all time-series is assumed)}

\item{anc}{vector of length two with the starting values for each of the two unbiased random walks.}

\item{tt}{vector of sample times (ages}
}
\value{
An evolutionary sequence (time-series) data set (a paleoTS object)
}
\description{
Function to simulate an evolutionary sequence data set with two Unbiased Random Walks separated by a punctuation event (jump in phenotype space)
}
\examples{
##Simulate an unbiased random walk where the rate decelerates through time.
x<-sim.Bokma(c(20,20))

## Plot the data
plot(x)
