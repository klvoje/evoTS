\title{Fit three OU models to three segments of an evolutionary sequence (time-series).}
\usage{
opt.joint.OU.OU.OU(y, gg, pool = TRUE, meth = "L-BFGS-B", hess = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{an univariate evoTS object.}

\item{gg}{numeric vector indicating membership of each sample in segments.}

\item{pool}{logical indicating whether to pool variances across samples}

\item{meth}{optimization method, passed to function optim. Default is "L-BFGS-B".}

\item{hess}{logical, indicating whether to calculate standard errors from the Hessian matrix.}
}
\value{
\item{logL}{the log-likelihood of the optimal solution}
\item{AICc}{AIC with a correction for small sample sizes}
\item{parameters}{parameter estimates}
\item{modelName}{abbreviated model name}
\item{method}{Joint consideration of all samples}
\item{K}{number of parameters in the model}
\item{n}{the number of observations/samples}
\item{all.logl}{log-likelihoods for all tested partitions of the series into segments. Will return a single value if shift points have been given}
\item{GG}{matrix of indices of initial samples of each tested segment configuration; each column of GG corresponds to the elements of all.logl}
}
\description{
Function to find maximum likelihood solutions to three OU models to three different segments of an evolutionary sequence. Most users will interact with this function through the function fit.OU.OU.OU.
}
\note{
The models have been implemented to be compatible with the joint parameterization routine in the package paleoTS. The optimization is therefore fit using the actual sample values, with the autocorrelation among samples accounted for in the log-likelihood function. The joint distribution of sample means is multivariate normal, with means and variance-covariances determined by evolutionary parameters and sampling errors.
