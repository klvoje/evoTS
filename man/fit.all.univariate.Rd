\title{Fit all univariate models to an evolutionary sequence (time-series).}
\usage{
fit.all.univariate(y)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{an univariate paleoTS object.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list of all investigated models and their highest log-likelihood (and their corresponding AICc and AICc weight).
}
\description{
Wrapper function to find maximum likelihood solutions for all univariate models (excluding models with mode shifts) to an evolutionary sequence (time-series).
}
\examples{
## Generate an univariate evolutionary sequence data set
x <- paleoTS::sim.GRW(30)

## Fit a the model to the data by defining shift points.
fit.all.univariate(x)
