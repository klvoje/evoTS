# evoTS 1.0.2

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in how the variance-covariance matrix of the decelerated and accelerated models were defined. 

## Other changes

- Implemented a change in the box constraints in the L-BFGS-B method for the multivariate accelerated and decelerated models. 
- Updated the list of messages to print as part of the output based on how the 'optim' function may fail while searching for the maximum likelihood for multivariate unbiased random walk models.
